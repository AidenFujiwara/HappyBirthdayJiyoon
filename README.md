Dear Jiyoon,

Happy 22nd birthday. You are very old but that's okay. You're still pretty cool I guess. I trust you are enjoying your trip in Korea so far, and I hope you continue to have a good time. Unfortunately, I lack card making materials, so I made the next best thing: a [website](https://aidenfujiwara.github.io/HappyBirthdayJiyoon/). And by made I mean yoinked from the internet with a few small modifications.

I am grateful for our friendship and appreciate how close we have gotten recently. You are a very important person to me and deserve nothing but the best. Let's play some league or valorant or any game you want really when you get back to the States! We still need to watch Her and Oppenheimer sometime too.

I am very excited to live together in March. It will be very fun. We will hangout every single day whether you like it or not, but It's not like I want to spend time with you or anything. It'll just be convient since we'll be roommates. Don't get the wrong idea or anything.

Love,  
Aiden
